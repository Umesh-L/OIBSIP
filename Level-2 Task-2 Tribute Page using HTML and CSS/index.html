      <p>
        I admire Robert Downey Jr. for bringing Tony Stark, the iconic Iron Man, to life. 
As a CS engineering student, I find his brilliance, courage, and creativity a 
constant source of motivation.
      </p>

      <h2>What I Adore About Him</h2>
      <p>
        Tony Stark shows how intelligence and innovation can be true superpowers. 
With just his skills, he created the Iron Man suit, proving that knowledge 
and determination can change the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        His journey from a self-centered billionaire to a selfless hero inspires me 
to grow not just in skills, but also in character. His resilience and 
sacrifice remind me that great innovation must always be guided by humanity.
